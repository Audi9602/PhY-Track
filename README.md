This is a simple python project just for fun, that provides some basic stuff about any phone number (along with country code) user enters. The stuff is supposed to be, **Location** (in a map-html file) and **Service Provider** name for that sim card. Basically it depends on using the phonenumbers library for parsing and extracting information from phone numbers. For our desitred stuff, it primarily has stuff like _geocoder_ and _carrier_ to determine **location** and carrier or **service provider** details respectively. And then uses _opencage_geocoder_ to get the location or their concerned geographical coordinates (_lattitudes & longitudes_) which is used to plot a **map using folium**. the map is saved in a** HTML file**.
