This is a simple python project just for fun, that provides some basic stuff about any phone number (along with country code) user enters. The stuff is supposed to be, Location (in a map-html file) and Service Provider name for that sim card. Basically it depends on using the phonenumbers library for parsing and extracting information from phone numbers. For our desitred stuff, it primarily has stuff like geocoder and carrier to determine location and carrier or service provider details respectively. And then uses opencage_geocoder to get the location or their concerned geographical coordinates which is used to plot a map using folium. the map is saved in a HTML file.
